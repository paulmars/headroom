"""Anthropic OAuth plan-usage fetcher (CodexBar-equivalent).

Owns Claude OAuth material under `~/.headroom/oauth/`, importing from Claude
Code's Keychain or `~/.claude/.credentials.json` whenever Headroom has nothing
it can still renew. Refreshed tokens are written only to Headroom's store —
never back into Claude Code's Keychain item, which races that app's own
refresh.

Claude Code's Keychain services remain an *import* source only:

    Claude Code-credentials-<sha256(config dir)[:8]>

The old unqualified `Claude Code-credentials` service and credential files
remain import fallbacks. While the imported grant is renewable the LaunchAgent
never touches a foreign Keychain item; once it is not, re-import is the only
way back, so "import once and never again" is exactly the bug to avoid — it
strands the daemon on a dead login that no `claude /login` can reach.

Keychain reads go through SecItemCopyMatching (see keychain.py). A user Deny
is sticky until Settings refresh re-arms it — collapsing Deny into a miss
used to re-prompt every fail TTL.

Stdlib only. The endpoint is undocumented and may change; failures degrade
to an empty quota dict so the desk gadget still shows local cost data.
