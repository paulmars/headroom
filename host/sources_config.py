"""The source registry: one entry per thing Headroom watches.

This is the single place that knows a source exists. Adding one means adding a
row to BASE_SOURCES — the HTTP payload, the Mac Settings list, the ESP32
footer, the poll schedule, and the log line all follow from it. Enabled flags
persist to ~/.headroom/sources.json; both Mac Settings and the ESP32 read them
back via /usage → sources[].

Quota providers (Claude / Codex / Cursor / …) are sources with kind="quota"
plus pool specs. POOLS, daily-burn headlines, and /usage → providers[] all
derive from those rows — so a Claude-only user can disable the rest, and a
new provider is one registry entry + a fetcher rather than a client enum.

`kind` is about metering; `group` is about what the thing *is*. Onboarding and
Settings split rows by group: the AI coding tools you're signed into locally
(no keys to paste) versus the dev tools you connect with a token. Section
titles live in Shared/HeadroomCopy.swift — the registry only owns membership.

A provider whose credentials live at a path you can point elsewhere carries an
`account_kind`, and then a second login is a second row: the registry expands
`claude` into `claude` plus `claude:work` at import (see accounts.py). Every
consumer already iterates the registry, so extra accounts get their own poll,
their own samples, their own burndown and their own ring for free — and the
default login keeps the bare id, so nothing stored under it moves.

Stdlib only.

# whether a *source* feeds the quota machinery at all (quota vs activity). The
# two words are unavoidable: one describes a service, one describes a meter.
#
# Only window, grant, overage and balance are implemented. The rest are named
# anyway, because the set *is* the design: a form with no name here is a form
# that arrives as flat keys bolted onto a provider payload, which is the thing
# docs/metering.md exists to stop. Naming one costs a string; discovering you
# needed it costs a schema.
